# Preface {-}

>Reproducibility---the ability to recompute results---and replicability---the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result---are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research [@RN20918].

Jowell knives from 41AN13 and 41HS261 comprise the two largest samples of this ill-understood lithic type from the ancestral Caddo area. All are thought to have been manufactured using Edwards chert, and acquired by the Caddo through trade with central Texas groups. Due to the very real possibility that these knives incorporate unique knapping signatures from two discrete culture areas, the sample from each site was divided into two size classes; one reflective of Caddo selection/preference (longer), and the other associated with Caddo resharpening and/or retouch (shorter). The size classes were used to assess whether modifications by Caddo knappers may have yielded a similar---convergent---knife shape in the smaller size class, and to test the hypothesis that greater shape variation would also be apparent in the smaller size class due to wear associated with regular use, paired with variable idiosyncracies related to resharpening and/or retouch. The large and small size classes were found to be significantly thicker at 41HS261, suggesting a local preference for thicker knives. While the shape of Jowell knives from the large size class differed significantly between sites, the small size class did not, advancing the argument for convergent morphology. In contrast to the expectation that greater shape diversity would articulate with Caddo resharpening and/or retouch practices, significant diversity in shape was instead found to articulate with Caddo selection/preference.

## Primary findings



### Linear metrics

Linear metrics were used to assess differences in width and thickness within and between size classes. Since maximum length was used to parse the sample, it was omitted from the ANOVAs.

 -    Large Jowell knives from 41AN13 and 41HS261 **differ significantly** in thickness
 -    Small Jowell knives from 41AN13 and 41HS261 **differ significantly** in thickness
 
Thus, while thickness differs for size classes between sites, it does not differ between the large and small size classes within sites. This result supports the interpretation that the Caddo from 41HS261 preferred a thicker knife; at least, insofar as they appear to have been selecting for---and maintaining---a product that was significantly thicker.

### Geometric morphometrics

Geometric morphometrics was used to assess differences in size and shape within and between size classes.

  -   Jowell knives recovered at 41AN13 and 41HS261 **differ significantly in shape** at their larger size
  -   Morphological disparity is **significantly greater** in the _large size class_ at 41AN13
  
The shape of Jowell knives differs significantly at their _larger size_, but not at their _smaller size_, supporting the argument for convergent morphology through Caddo resharpening and/or retouch.  While not significant, the graphic associated with the phenotypic trajectory analysis also illustrates morphological convergence. Results for the analysis of morphological disparity demonstrate the inverse of what was expected, supporting the interpretation that greater shape diversity is associated with Caddo selection/preference, instead of Caddo resharpening and/or retouch practices.

## Acknowledgments

My thanks to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Caddo Nation Tribal Council, Tribal Chairman, and Tribal Historic Preservation Office for permission and access to NAGPRA and previously repatriated collections. My gratitude is also extended to Julian A. Sitters and Timothy K. Perttula for providing the linear measurements and images from their documentation effort. Thanks also to John Harman for access to the DStretch plugin for ImageJ that was useful in the analysis of flake scars, and to Harry J. Shafer, Hiram F. (Pete) Gregory, Christian S. Hoggard, and David K. Thulman for their comments and constructive criticisms on the analyses of Caddo biface morphology, and to Emma Sherratt, Kersten Bergstrom, Dean C. Adams, and Michael L. Collyer for their constructive criticisms, general comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research program.

## Funding

Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to analyse the Jowell knives from 41AN13 and 41HS261 was provided by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University.

## Data management

The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document, is available in the GitHub repository, and is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this enterprise provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology [@RN20804;@RN21009;@RN11783;@RN21001;@RN9364], and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results [@RN21007]. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have---explicitly or implicitly---a major impact on scientific progress [@RN21008].
