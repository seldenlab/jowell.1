# Preface {-}

>Reproducibility---the ability to recompute results---and replicability---the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result---are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research [@RN20918].

Elliptical bifaces from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm (41AN13) comprise two of the largest samples of this ill-understood lithic type from the ancestral Caddo area. Similar to Gahagan bifaces, the bifaces from Jowell Farm are assumed to have been manufactured using Edwards chert---primarily due to their size, the colour that they fluoresce beneath a blacklight, and the paucity of similarly large locally-available raw material sources---and acquired by the Caddo through trade with central Texas groups. Those from the Millsap Cache are thought to have been manufactured from Kay County flint. Due to the very real possibility that these knives incorporate unique knapping signatures, the sample from each site was divided into two size classes; one reflective of initial production/manufacture (longer), and the other associated with resharpening and/or retouch (shorter). The size classes were used to assess whether modifications by Caddo knappers may have yielded a similar---convergent---knife shape in the smaller size class, and to test the hypothesis that greater morphological variation would be apparent in the smaller size class due to wear associated with regular use, paired with variable idiosyncracies related to resharpening and/or retouch. Biface size associated with the large size class does not differ between sites; however, the small size class does, advancing an argument for divergent morphology. In alignment with expectations, greater shape diversity was found to articulate with production/manufacturing practices in the Millsap Cache bifaces; however the same was not true at Jowell Farm. Discrete biogeographical ranges in conjunction with raw material differences are posited as potential drivers of extant morphological differences among elliptical bifaces.

## Primary findings

Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system [@RN11622;@RN11623;@RN11563], achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition [@RN478] performed in R 4.1.3 [@R] using the `geomorph` library v. 4.0.3 [@RN11530;@RN1774;@RN9565]. Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects [@RN11564;@RN478]. The `geomorph` package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space [@RN1646;@RN11563]. 

  -   Bifaces in the _large size class_ recovered from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm do not differ in size
  -   Bifaces in the _small size class_ recovered from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm **differ significantly** in size
  -   Morphological disparity is **significantly greater** for the _large size class_ from the Millsap cache, suggesting greater diversity in size associated with production/manufacture

Principal components analysis [@RN1746] was used to visualise shape variation among the Perdiz arrow points. The shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference 3D mesh [@RN1731;@RN479].

```

A phenotypic trajectory analysis [@RN8344;@RN8550;@RN8569;@RN8533;@RN8446] was used to assess whether reduction/retouch trajectories differ between the sites. The trajectory analysis was followed by an analysis of morphological disparity [@RN11107;@RN7041;@RN5694] to identify potential differences in morphological diversity between size classes.

```{r figjowellmshape, fig.cap="Resharpening trajectories do not differ, but illustrate divergent morphology. In this case, greater morphological similarity is evident in the larger size class, and morphological differences increase following resharpening and/or retouch by Caddo knappers."}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/trajectory.png')
```

The shape of the bifaces does not differ significantly in either size class; however, size does. While not rising to the level of significance, the graphic associated with the phenotypic trajectory analysis illustrates morphological divergence. Results for the analysis of morphological disparity yielded support for the interpretation that greater morphological diversity is associated with production, instead of resharpening and/or retouch practices. As the bifaces are reworked to meet the variable needs of Caddo users, their morphology diverges. This finding supports the working hypothesis that the bifaces may have been used for different tasks.

Our gratitude is also extended to Marybeth Tomka and Lauren Bussiere at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory for their assistance with access to the bifaces and the associated records, and to Scott Hammerstedt at the Oklahoma Archeological Survey for his assistance with records requests. Thanks also to John Harman for access to the DStretch plugin for ImageJ that was useful in the analysis of flake scars, and to Harry J. Shafer, Hiram F. (Pete) Gregory, Christian S. Hoggard, and David K. Thulman for their comments and constructive criticisms on the ongoing analyses of Caddo biface morphology, and to Emma Sherratt, Kersten Bergstrom, Dean C. Adams, and Michael L. Collyer for their constructive criticisms, general comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research program.

## Funding

Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to analyse the bifaces from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm was provided by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University.

## Data management

The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document, is available in the GitHub repository, and digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this enterprise provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology [@RN20804;@RN21009;@RN11783;@RN21001;@RN9364], and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results [@RN21007]. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have---explicitly or implicitly---a major impact on scientific progress [@RN21008].
