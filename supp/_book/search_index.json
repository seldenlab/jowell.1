Selden, Jr.1 2022-07-03 Preface Reproducibility—the ability to recompute results—and replicability—the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result—are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). Jowell knives from 41AN13 and 41HS261 comprise the two largest samples of this ill-understood lithic type from the ancestral Caddo area. All are thought to have been manufactured using Edwards chert, and acquired by the Caddo through trade with central Texas groups. Due to the very real possibility that these knives bear two discrete knapping signatures, the sample from each site was subset into two size classes reflective of original manufacture (longer), and local Caddo resharpening efforts (shorter). These categories were used to assess whether local Caddo resharpening practices resulted in similar—convergent—shapes in the smaller size class, and to test the hypothesis that greater shape variation would be apparent in the larger size class due to the influence of Caddo selective preference. The analysis of linear variables demonstrated that large and small Jowell knives differ in thickness between sites, where those from 41HS261 are thicker in both size classes, suggestive of a local preference for thicker knives. The geometric morphometric analysis demonstrated that while the shape of Jowell knives from the large size class differed between sites, the small size class did not, supporting the argument for convergent morphologies associated with local Caddo resharpening. The analysis of morphological disparity supports the argument for greater diversity in Jowell knife shape in the larger size class at 41AN13, supporting the argument for the occurrence of greater shape variability in Caddo selective preference, and where the shape of Jowell knives becomes more standardized through local resharpening efforts. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/jowell.illustration.png&#39;) Figure 0.1: Illustration of Jowell knives from 41AN13 and 41HS261, ordered by length. 0.1 Primary findings 0.1.1 Linear metrics Large and small Jowell knives from 41AN13 differ significantly in length, which was expected due to how the sample was parsed Large and small Jowell knives from 41HS261 differ significantly in length, which was expected due to how the sample was parsed Large Jowell knives from 41AN13 and 41HS261 differ significantly in thickness Small Jowell knives from 41AN13 and 41HS261 differ significantly in thickness knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/pcalinear.png&#39;) Figure 0.2: PCA of linear measures for Jowell knives from 41AN13_L/S and 41HS261_L/S. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/boxplot.png&#39;) Figure 0.3: Boxplots for linear measurements associated with Jowell knives from 41AN13 and 41HS261. 0.1.2 Geometric morphometrics Jowell knives recovered at 41AN13 and 41HS261 differ significantly in shape at their larger size, but not at their smaller size, demonstrating convergent morphology Morphological disparity is significantly greater in the large size class at 41AN13 knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/pca.png&#39;) Figure 0.4: PCA of shape variables for Jowell knives from 41AN13_L/S and 41HS261_L/S. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/trajectory.png&#39;) Figure 0.5: Resharpening trajectories do not differ, and illustrate convergent morphology as Jowell knives were resharpened by the Caddo. 0.2 Acknowledgments My thanks to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Caddo Nation Tribal Council, Tribal Chairman, and Tribal Historic Preservation Office for permission and access to NAGPRA and previously repatriated collections. My gratitude is also extended to Julian A. Sitters and Timothy K. Perttula for providing the linear measurements and images from their documentation effort. Thanks to John Harman for access to the DStretch plugin for ImageJ, to Harry J. Shafer, Hiram F. (Pete) Gregory, Christian S. Hoggard, and David K. Thulman for their comments and constructive criticisms on the analyses of Caddo biface morphology, and to Emma Sherratt, Kersten Bergstrom, Dean C. Adams, and Michael L. Collyer for their constructive criticisms, general comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research program. 0.3 Funding Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to analyse the Jowell knives from 41AN13 and 41HS261 was provided by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University. 0.4 Data management The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document. The reproducible nature of this enterprise provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovaite et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr et al. 2021), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018). 0.5 Colophon This version of the analysis was generated on 2022-07-03 06:07:45 using the following computational environment and dependencies: # what R packages and versions were used? if (&quot;devtools&quot; %in% installed.packages()) devtools::session_info() ## ─ Session info ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## setting value ## version R version 4.2.0 (2022-04-22 ucrt) ## os Windows 10 x64 (build 19044) ## system x86_64, mingw32 ## ui RTerm ## language (EN) ## collate English_United States.utf8 ## ctype English_United States.utf8 ## tz America/Chicago ## date 2022-07-03 ## pandoc 2.17.1.1 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/bin/quarto/bin/ (via rmarkdown) ## ## ─ Packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## package * version date (UTC) lib source ## bookdown 0.27 2022-06-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## bslib 0.3.1 2021-10-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## cachem 1.0.6 2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## callr 3.7.0 2021-04-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## cli 3.3.0 2022-04-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## crayon 1.5.1 2022-03-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## devtools 2.4.3 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## digest 0.6.29 2021-12-01 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## ellipsis 0.3.2 2021-04-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## evaluate 0.15 2022-02-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## fastmap 1.1.0 2021-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## fs 1.5.2 2021-12-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## glue 1.6.2 2022-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## highr 0.9 2021-04-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## htmltools 0.5.2 2021-08-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## jquerylib 0.1.4 2021-04-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## jsonlite 1.8.0 2022-02-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## knitr 1.39 2022-04-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## lifecycle 1.0.1 2021-09-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## magrittr 2.0.3 2022-03-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## memoise 2.0.1 2021-11-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## pkgbuild 1.3.1 2021-12-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## pkgload 1.3.0 2022-06-27 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## png 0.1-7 2013-12-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## prettyunits 1.1.1 2020-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## processx 3.6.1 2022-06-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## ps 1.7.1 2022-06-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## purrr 0.3.4 2020-04-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## R6 2.5.1 2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## remotes 2.4.2 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## rlang 1.0.3 2022-06-27 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## rmarkdown 2.14 2022-04-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## rstudioapi 0.13 2020-11-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## sass 0.4.1 2022-03-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## sessioninfo 1.2.2 2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## stringi 1.7.6 2021-11-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## stringr 1.4.0 2019-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## usethis 2.1.6 2022-05-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## xfun 0.31 2022-05-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## yaml 2.3.5 2022-02-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## ## [1] C:/Users/seldenjrz/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.2 ## [2] C:/Program Files/R/R-4.2.0/library ## ## ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Current Git commit details are: # where can I find this commit? if (&quot;git2r&quot; %in% installed.packages() &amp; git2r::in_repository(path = &quot;.&quot;)) git2r::repository(here::here()) ## Local: master D:/github/jowell-1 ## Remote: master @ origin (https://github.com/seldenlab/jowell-1) ## Head: [39b0a34] 2022-07-02: &lt;edit index&gt; References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
