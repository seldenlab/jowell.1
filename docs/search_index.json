Selden, Jr.1, and John E. Dockall2 2022-08-04 Preface Reproducibility—the ability to recompute results—and replicability—the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result—are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). Elliptical bifaces from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm (41AN13) sites comprise two of the largest samples of this ill-understood lithic tool from the ancestral Caddo area. Similar to Gahagan bifaces, the bifaces from Jowell Farm are assumed to have been manufactured using Edwards chert—primarily due to their size, the colour that they fluoresce beneath low and high frequency UV light, and the paucity of similarly large locally-available raw material sources—and acquired by the Caddo through trade with central Texas groups. Bifaces from the Millsap Cache are thought to have been manufactured from Kay County flint, providing for an empirical assessment of whether elliptical biface morphology differs as a function of raw material and/or biogeographical range. The sample from each site was subsequently divided into two size classes; one reflective of initial production/manufacture (larger), and the other associated with resharpening and/or retouch (smaller). Size classes were used to assess whether modifications by Caddo knappers may have yielded a similar—convergent—knife shape at the smaller size class, and to test the hypothesis that greater morphological variation would be apparent in that size class due to wear associated with regular use, paired with variable idiosyncracies related to resharpening and/or retouch. Results demonstrate that elliptical biface shape does not differ by raw material, but size does. This finding is suggestive of a shared mental template, but a size differential that is potentially driven by raw material and/or biogeographical differences. Additionally, elliptical biface size associated with the large size class does not differ between sites/raw materials; however, the small size class does. This finding aids in advancing an argument that elliptical biface morphology diverges through the resharpening trajectory, where bifaces from each site/raw material enter their uselife at similar shapes and sizes, but diverge significantly in size—but not shape—throughout that uselife. In alignment with our expectations, greater size diversity was found to articulate with production/manufacturing practices in the Millsap Cache bifaces. Discrete biogeographical ranges and raw material differences are posited as the drivers of extant morphological differences in elliptical bifaces from the ancestral Caddo area. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/map.png&#39;) Figure 0.1: Geological map illustrating the location of the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm, the level three ecoregions of the Arkansas Valley (blue), Ouachita Mountains (yellow), and South Central Plains (orange), and the boundary of the ancestral Caddo area (white) in the American Southeast. 0.1 Primary findings Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Rohlf and Slice 1990) performed in R 4.1.3 (R Core Development Team, 2022) using the geomorph library v. 4.0.3 (Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otarola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021). Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001). Bifaces do not differ in shape, but differ significantly in size by raw material/biogeography. Bifaces in the large size class recovered from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm do not differ in size. Thus, both shape and size were consistent among the large size class, suggesting production-based standardization. Bifaces in the small size class recovered from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm differ significantly in size. Thus, while shape remains consistent, size differs, suggesting—at minimum—local approaches to retouch and/or resharpening. Morphological disparity in the large size class is significantly greater than the small size class at the Millsap Cache. This suggests greater diversity in size associated with production/manufacture, rather than retouch and/or resharpening. Principal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualise shape variation among the elliptical bifaces. The shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference 3D mesh (Klingenberg 2013; Sherratt et al. 2014). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/pca.png&#39;) Figure 0.2: PCA of shape variables for elogated ovate bifaces. A phenotypic trajectory analysis (Adams and Collyer 2007, 2009; M. L. Collyer and Adams 2007, 2013; Michael. L. Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015) was used to assess whether reduction/retouch trajectories differ between the sites. The trajectory analysis was followed by an analysis of morphological disparity (M. L. Collyer and Adams 2020; Foote 1993; Zelditch et al. 2004) to identify potential differences in morphological diversity between size classes. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/trajectory.png&#39;) Figure 0.3: Resharpening trajectories do not differ, but illustrate divergent morphology. In this case, greater morphological similarity is evident in the larger size class, and morphological differences increase following resharpening and/or retouch by Caddo knappers. The shape of elliptical bifaces does not differ significantly at either size class; however, size does. While not rising to the level of significance, the graphic associated with the phenotypic trajectory analysis illustrates morphological divergence, a claim that is also supported by the results of the Procrustes ANOVA. Results for the analysis of morphological disparity yielded support for the interpretation that greater morphological diversity is associated with production, instead of resharpening and/or retouch practices. As the bifaces are reworked to meet the variable needs of Caddo users, their morphology diverges. This finding supports the working hypothesis that the bifaces may have been used for different tasks. 0.2 Acknowledgments Our thanks to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Caddo Nation Tribal Council, Tribal Chairman, and Tribal Historic Preservation Office for permission and access to NAGPRA and previously repatriated collections.

Funding to analyse the bifaces from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm was provided by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University. 0.4 Data management The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document, is available in the GitHub repository, and digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this enterprise provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovaite et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr et al. 2021), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018). 0.5 Colophon This version of the analysis was generated on 2022-08-04 12:24:37 using the following computational environment and dependencies: # what R packages and versions were used? if (&quot;devtools&quot; %in% installed.packages()) devtools::session_info() ## ─ Session info ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## setting value ## version R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23 ucrt) ## os Windows 10 x64 (build 19044) ## system x86_64, mingw32 ## ui RTerm ## language (EN) ## collate English_United States.utf8 ## ctype English_United States.utf8 ## tz America/Chicago ## date 2022-08-04 ## pandoc 2.18 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/bin/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown) ## ## ─ Packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## package * version date (UTC) lib source ## bookdown 0.27 2022-06-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## bslib 0.4.0 2022-07-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## cachem 1.0.6 2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## callr 3.7.1 2022-07-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## cli 3.3.0 2022-04-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## crayon 1.5.1 2022-03-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## devtools 2.4.4 2022-07-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## digest 0.6.29 2021-12-01 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## ellipsis 0.3.2 2021-04-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## evaluate 0.15 2022-02-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## fastmap 1.1.0 2021-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## fs 1.5.2 2021-12-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## glue 1.6.2 2022-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## highr 0.9 2021-04-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## htmltools 0.5.3 2022-07-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## htmlwidgets 1.5.4 2021-09-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## httpuv 1.6.5 2022-01-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## jquerylib 0.1.4 2021-04-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## jsonlite 1.8.0 2022-02-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## knitr 1.39 2022-04-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## later 1.3.0 2021-08-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## lifecycle 1.0.1 2021-09-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## magrittr 2.0.3 2022-03-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## memoise 2.0.1 2021-11-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## mime 0.12 2021-09-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## miniUI 0.1.1.1 2018-05-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## pkgbuild 1.3.1 2021-12-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## pkgload 1.3.0 2022-06-27 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## png 0.1-7 2013-12-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## prettyunits 1.1.1 2020-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## processx 3.7.0 2022-07-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## profvis 0.3.7 2020-11-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## promises 1.2.0.1 2021-02-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## ps 1.7.1 2022-06-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## purrr 0.3.4 2020-04-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## R6 2.5.1 2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## Rcpp 1.0.9 2022-07-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## remotes 2.4.2 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## rlang 1.0.4 2022-07-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## rmarkdown 2.14 2022-04-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## rstudioapi 0.13 2020-11-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## sass 0.4.2 2022-07-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## sessioninfo 1.2.2 2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## shiny 1.7.2 2022-07-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## stringi 1.7.8 2022-07-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## stringr 1.4.0 2019-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## urlchecker 1.0.1 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## usethis 2.1.6 2022-05-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## xfun 0.31 2022-05-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## xtable 1.8-4 2019-04-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## yaml 2.3.5 2022-02-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## ## [1] C:/Users/seldenjrz/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.2 ## [2] C:/Program Files/R/R-4.2.1/library ## ## ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Current Git commit details are: # where can I find this commit? if (&quot;git2r&quot; %in% installed.packages() &amp; git2r::in_repository(path = &quot;.&quot;)) git2r::repository(here::here()) ## Local: master E:/github/jowell.1 ## Remote: master @ origin (https://github.com/seldenlab/jowell.1) ## Head: [91997ba] 2022-08-04: &lt;edit index&gt; References "]]
